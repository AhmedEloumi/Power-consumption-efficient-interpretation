# Energy Consumption Forecasting 

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting energy consumption patterns using time series data from a household energy monitoring system of datasetfrom kaggle. The goal is to gain insights into energy usage trends and develop accurate forecasting models that can provide valuable information for optimizing energy consumption and making informed decisions :
Provide real-time data to understand the energy usage. 
Conducts data visualization and exploratory data analysis. 
Implement times series prediction models to forecast users' future energy consumption patterns.

## Key Features:

### Data Collection: 
The project starts by collecting data from a household energy monitoring system, including attributes such as date, time, global active power, global reactive power, voltage, global intensity, and sub-metering measurements.

### Data Preprocessing: 
The collected data is cleaned, transformed, and preprocessed to ensure accuracy and compatibility with various analysis and modeling techniques. This includes handling missing values, scaling, normalization, and feature engineering, removing outliers...

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
EDA is performed to visualize and understand the data's distribution, trends, and correlations. This step helps identify patterns and insights that can guide subsequent analysis.

### Time Series Analysis: 
Time series techniques, including ARIMA, SARIMA,  LSTM, LR ... are used to analyze historical energy consumption patterns and make short-term and long-term energy consumption forecasts.
Train several models to predict the future data such as Liner regression model, XGBoost, Deep Neural Network, Arimaâ€¦
Compare the models using RMSE (Root Mean Square Error).

### Model Evaluation: 
Various performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are used to evaluate the accuracy of forecasting models.

### Deployment: 
The trained models are deployed to predict future energy consumption based on new data, allowing users to make informed decisions for energy optimization.

This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of energy consumption patterns, offer accurate forecasts, and contribute to sustainable energy management practices.
